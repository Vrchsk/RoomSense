# RoomSense

RoomSense is a smart room allocation simulator that assigns classrooms
based on constraints and explains every decision clearly.

## Why RoomSense?
Most allocation systems only check capacity.
RoomSense also explains *why* a room is chosen or rejected.

- Best-fit optimization
- Explainable decision log
- Lightweight and fast

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- HTML, CSS

## Future Improvements
- Time slot scheduling
- Cost-aware allocation
